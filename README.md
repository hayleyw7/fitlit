# FitLit

This is a website that can log data from a fitness tracker and present it on a user dashboard. A user will be able to see their latest activity data, goals, and milestones.


## Motivation and rubric

This project was completed as a project at Turing School of Software & Design during Module 2.

[The rubric is linked here.](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/fitlit.html)

## Reflections

A challenge was working on APIs, as this is the first lesson at Turing where this came up.

Referencing those datasets through the API was definitely a learning experience.

## Languages

Written in JavaScript (Mocha, Chai), HTML, & CSS

## Technology used

Built with Visual Studio Code & Atom
