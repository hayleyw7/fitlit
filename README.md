# FitLit

This is a website that can log data from a fitness tracker and present it on a user dashboard. A user will be able to see their latest activity data, goals, and milestones.


## Motivation and rubric

This project was completed as a project at Turing School of Software & Design during Module 2.

[The rubric is linked here.](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/fitlit.html)

## Reflections

A challenge was working on APIs, as this is the first lesson at Turing where this came up.

Referencing those datasets through the API was definitely a learning experience.

## Languages

Written in JavaScript (Mocha, Chai), HTML, & CSS

## Technology used

Built with Visual Studio Code & Atom

## Access and use website

Enter the following URL in your internet browser:

When the site loads, a user will see two colorful sections: sidebar and widgets.

### Sidebar

After opening the website, the user will be greeted by name. The sidebar also includes their contact information, as well as a calendar. The calendar can be used to access the data of a specific time period.

### Widgets

The user will be able to see their Goals, Activity, Hydration, and Sleep data in separate sections. Each section includes widgets with either a) labelled numbers, or b) graphs, over which a user can hover to see specific numbers and headings. These widgets are regularly updated through the day, week, month, and beyond.

* The Goals section includes a chart of the user's daily step goal and a chart comparing it to the average step goal of the website's community.

* The Activity section includes a left graph of the user's steps, miles, and active minutes during the current day. The top right of the section contains the same data, but for the week in numbers. Underneath, there is a bar graph comparing the data community-wide.

* In the Hydration section, the left chart contains the amount of water consumed today, and the right chart contains that data from the last week, separated by date.

* For Sleep, the top left chart displays you sleep quality and hours slept last night, the respective weekly numbers are next to it, and the all-time numbers are below.

## GIF
